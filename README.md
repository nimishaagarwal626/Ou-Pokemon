 ## Emoji Chooser

 I am fixing the board size N x N to be 8 x 8.
 I am prompting the user to enter the number of pokemons and trainers and accordingly my ruamel program will pick these supplied data and generate the  docker-compose.yml file.
 I am giving a list of emojis to the user and they will choose through command line arguments.

 I am going to use:
 Emojis for Pokemon:
 🐶 Dog Face
 🐺 Wolf
 🦊 Foxemoji
 🦁 Lion

 Emojis for Trainer: 
 💁‍♀️ Woman Tipping Hand
 👶 Baby
 👀 Eyes
 👻 Ghost
