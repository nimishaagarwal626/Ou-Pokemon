 ## Emoji Chooser

 I am fixing the board size N x N to be 8 x 8.
 For P and T, I am going to use 4 pokemon and 4 trainers which i will be passing as static value in docker-compose file.
 I am giving a list of emojis to the user and they will choose through command line arguments.

 I am going to use:
 Emojis for Pokemon:
 🐶 Dog Face
 🐺 Wolf
 🦊 Foxemoji
 🦁 Lion

 Emojis for Trainer: 
 💁‍♀️ Woman Tipping Hand
 👶 Baby
 👀 Eyes
 👻 Ghost

 I am still learning how to create a docker-compose file to include multiple players as clients.
